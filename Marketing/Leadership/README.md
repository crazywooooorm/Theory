## Is money a good motivator?
Money is more like a push motivator rather than a pull motivator, which means it can make people do something but wouldn't make people want to do something. Money works well when the salary is under a certain amount. Cutting money will definitely do harm to people's performance but increasing money doesn't necessarily improve people's performance. The motivating effect of money actually comes from the security or praise brought from money rather than money itself. In a word, money shouldn't be one of the top motivators in your mind.

## In leadership style, what is the difference between delegate, empower and abdicate?
* Delegate requires the leader to both monitor the work and offer support. The team is responsible for the work and in control of the details by themselves, but the leader needs to check the quality from time to time.
* Empower doesn't require the leader to monitor the team because he completely trusts the team, while he still needs to offer support when the team has problems. Empower is more motivating but also more risky compared to delegate.
* Abdicate means the leader neither monitors not offers support. It's like the leader doesn't really care about the work. This leadership style is something we absolutely don't want to pick.
