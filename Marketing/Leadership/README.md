## Is money a good motivator?
Money is more like a push motivator rather than a pull motivator, which means it can make people do something but wouldn't make people want to do something. Money works well when the salary is under a certain amount. Cutting money will definitely do harm to people's performance but increasing money doesn't necessarily improve people's performance. The motivating effect of money actually comes from the security or praise brought from money rather than money itself. In a word, money shouldn't be one of the top motivators in your mind. You can design your motivator based on [Maslow](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/Theory/blob/master/Marketing/Leadership/Motivation_by_Maslow.pdf). Also you can find some practical [motivation tips](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/Theory/blob/master/Marketing/Leadership/Motivation_Tips.pdf).

## In leadership style, what is the difference between delegate, empower and abdicate?
Different [leadership styles](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/Theory/blob/master/Marketing/Leadership/Leadership_Style.pdf) have different time require and control levels.
* [Delegate](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/Theory/blob/master/Marketing/Leadership/Steps_to_Delegating.pdf) requires the leader to both monitor the work and offer support. The team is responsible for the work and in control of the details by themselves, but the leader needs to check the quality from time to time.
* Empower doesn't require the leader to monitor the team because he completely trusts the team, while he still needs to offer support when the team has problems. Empower is more motivating but also more risky compared to delegate.
* Abdicate means the leader neither monitors not offers support. It's like the leader doesn't really care about the work. This leadership style is something we absolutely don't want to pick.

## How to choose the proper leadership style?
It depends on [what type of employee](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/Theory/blob/master/Marketing/Leadership/Different_People_Type.pdf) you have. People lack of competence (knowledge and skills) need more instructions and people lack of motivation needs more ownership and trust. Also, you can decide what [control style](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/Theory/blob/master/Marketing/Leadership/Control_Styles.pdf) and how much [freedom](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/Theory/blob/master/Marketing/Leadership/Freedom_Ladder.pdf) you want to offer based on who they are.

## So what exactly should a leader do?
Leaders have [multiple types of task](https://github.com/crazywooooorm/Theory/blob/master/Marketing/Leadership/Regular_Management_Tasks.pdf): for team, leader has to build a strategy and plan for everything; for employee, leader has to motivate, support and monitor; for self, leader has to review and keep learning.
