# What is AARRR?
AARRR is a metric framework in Growth Hacker theory, it is used to understand the customer journey and optimize our funnel to reach our business goal.
AARRR stands for Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral and Revenue, which are considered as the five most important metrics for a startup to focus on.

# Introduction of each metric

## Acquisition

### Concept
* Tracks how people find you and convert into your customer. We should look at all the channels that can possibly drive traffic to our website and product.
* We don't only focus on the the site visitors of each channel but also how many those visitor convert into customer through each channel.
* Not all the channels are effective, and we need to consider the cost. So, to help us find the optimal channel, ask 3 questions:
  * What channel is driving the most traffic
  * What channel is driving the most valuable traffic (i.e. best customer conversion rate)
  * What channel has the lowest customer acquisition cost

### Metrics
* CAC (customer acquisition cost): Total acquisition cost (sales & marketing) divided by total number of new customers
* CLTV (customer life value): The recurring revenue you can expect from a new customer over the duration of their partnership with you. You want to make sure your CLTV is bigger than your CAC
* Conversion Rate: Percentage of people become your customer among all those who visited your site.


## Activation

### Concept
* Activation is about the first experience your customer has with your product. Download or Sign-up is not enough, to make people actively using the product, we need to show them the real value of the product.
* To increase activation, different companies have different strategies. Facebook found more connections would bring activation, Twitter found more following would bring activation, Dropbox found more uploaded files would bring activation, so they just try to make these actions happen right after people download or sign up.

### Metrics
* Activation Rate: Percentage of people who activated the product among all those signed up.


## Retention

### Concept
* Retention means people regularly come back to use your product. It can be people buying from you multiple times or staying subscribed.
* The opposite of customer retention is customer churn. Customer churn rate is incredibly important, as once churn rate is higher than acquisition rate, the product is stop growing, and acquiring a new customer can be much more expensive (5 to 25 times) to retain an existing member.

### Metrics
* Customer Churn Rate: Percentage of customer loss during a period
* Revenue Churn Rate: Percentage of revenue loss from losing customers
* DAU, MAU: Daily Active Users, Monthly Active Users
* DAU/MAU Ratio: A metric measures stickiness. 50% DAU/MAU ratio means on average people are using your product 15 out of 30 days for that month.
