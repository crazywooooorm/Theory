[Origin post](https://stellarpeers.com/how-would-you-design-and-monetize-an-ice-cream-stand-in-central-park/)

## Clarify
* target metric: revenue or profit?
* time: seasonal or all-year?
* other restrictions: one-location or move? labor cost?

## Find pain points from customer segments
* families: better be interesting to attract kids
* friends: better to have many flavors and easy to pay
* single people: don't want to lose their spot
* tourists: don't want to wait too long

## Summarize pain points and offer solutions
* accessibility: let ice-cream tricycles come to people instead of people coming to ice-cream
* speed: support more payment methods to shorten the waiting time; using app to pre order
* fun: add some lottery or games to attract kids

## List options and score them
* score **impact** and **cost** of each option
* options:
  * tricycle: very accessible, but needs labor cost and can't have too many flavors
  * vending machine: cover many flavors, but not interesting and having high cost
  * circus-style performance: very interesting, but don't have good accessibility

## Optimize choice and consider other risks
* use app to streamline order, payment and delivery
* use lottery, discount and games to attract different customer segments
* try let our plan more flexible (avoid long-term loss) so we can change strategy easily
