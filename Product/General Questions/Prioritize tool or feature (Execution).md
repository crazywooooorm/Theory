# How would you prioritize a tool vs. a feature?
(How would you prioritize between a new product feature versus an internal tool that would build this feature quicker and easier in the future?)

[Origin post](https://stellarpeers.com/how-would-you-prioritize-a-tool-vs-a-feature/)

## Clarify
* Is it a single product or a platform (including multiple products)?
* What metrics to be considered (e.g. engagement, revenue...)?
* More details about the difference between tool and feature: tool needs more time to develop but makes more impact in future?

## Formulate a framework to make decision
* Market:
  * Emerging or growing: tool makes more sense, speed up product release to capture market share faster
  * Mature or declining: not make sense to invest on a tool
* Tool reusability: if the tool is reusable in future
* Cost of time: Check with engineering team about how valuable the tool would be to save team's capacity
* Cost of money: Estimate the long-term value of the tool, and check if it can cover the development cost
