  * Live: DAU -> video watch length per day -> number of video ads -> ad revenue per year
  * Marketplace: DAU -> Facebook sessions from marketplace per day -> impressions/clicks from sessions -> ad revenue per year
* Cost (labor cost): salary per engineer * number of engineers needed
* Calculate ROI from revenue and cost
