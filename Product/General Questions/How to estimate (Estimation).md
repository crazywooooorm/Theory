# How to estimate XXX?

## Clarify
* What is the metric you are estimating? It could be revenue, counts or any metric related to product. Need to clarify how is that metric generated, like what are the events that generate revenue or what is the customer journey that leads to the count.
* What is the scope of the estimation, like time scope and population scope.
* A useful rule we can use in estimation is 20/80 rule. For example, if we are able to estimate the revenue of our top 20% main customers, then we already covered 80% of our revenue.

## Design estimation tree
* Write down your main formula, what is the main component of your estimation? Then, keep digging deeper, what is the subcomponent of each main component? Finally we will have an estimation tree, the root is our target metric and the bottom are the most basic elements we needed for our estimation.
* Estimated those bottom elements based on your best understanding.
* Calculate the estimation tree from bottom to top.

## Review the estimation
* Check if the final estimation is in ballpark if you know the benchmark. If not we should review the estimation tree, and check our assumptions. We might be too aggressive or conservative on some estimations, or we might miss some important components in our estimation tree.
