# What is a typical approach to set a goal for product?

## Clarify
* What is the product?
  * What is the key event and customer journey of the product
  * How does the product make money

## State the product goal
* What is the stage of our product? Brand new product focuses more on acquisition while mature product focuses more on retention and revenue.
* What metric can best describe the key event, which show the true value, of our product?

## Define metrics
* For each step among AARRR that you care, define some metrics. They can be counts, proportion or ratio
* Among the metrics you defined, pick one metric for each step as your north start metric. It should be the most representative metric for this step.
* Check the potential problems of your metric. No metric can be perfect: count can't reflect proportion, ratio can't reflect volume, click doesn't mean real view, RSVP doesn't mean real participation. Think through the metric and find some solutions for those potential problems.
