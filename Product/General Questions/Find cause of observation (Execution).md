# How would you find the cause of a 15% drop in Facebook Groups usage?

[Origin post](https://stellarpeers.com/how-would-you-find-the-cause-of-a-15-drop-in-facebook-groups-usage/)

## Clarify what is dropping
* creation or engagement
* what are the measurement metrics

## High level reasons
* Users creating, replying, reacting or sharing fewer post on Facebook groups?
* Users going to alternative features?

## Gather context info
* Time: one time drop might be tech issue, progressively drop needs more research
* Region: regulation or competitive products in certain regions
* Platform: drop on certain platform (ios, android...) might come from tech issue or switching platforms
* Other features: if other features also see same phenomenon then needs to check overall engagement
* Competitor: check if same thing happen at competitors, if so then might be industry regulation problems

## Test theories and fix the problem
* If none of the context aspects can explain, keep checking original theories
* creating, replying, reacting or sharing fewer post on Facebook groups?
  * Any tech issue (group post not correctly displayed, notification not working well) shouldn't be progressively
  * more spam make people leave Facebook groups?
* alternative features?
  * new features attract people from Facebook groups feature, people might switch
  * competitor take users away
