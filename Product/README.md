## Business Models

### True Cases
* WeWork
  * Pros: The differences between WeWork and its competitors are basically: 1. It offers great utilities. 2. It creates the culture of community and keeps reminding people of this. 3. They use good analysis to find the best place in the cities.
  * Cons: 1. WeWork's revenue is still based on the gap between rent paid by its customers and rent paid to landlord. It costs way more money to build those fancy utilities and design the space for community building, while not so many companies are willing to pay extra money on working space just for those features. 2. Many customers of WeWork are actually in the weakest position in case of an economic downturn, which is a big risk for WeWork.
