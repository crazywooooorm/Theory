# Business Models

## True Cases
* WeWork
  * Pros: The differences between WeWork and its competitors are basically: 1. It offers great utilities. 2. It creates the culture of community and keeps reminding people of this. 3. They use good analysis to find the best place in the cities.
  * Cons: 1. WeWork's revenue is still based on the gap between rent paid by its customers and rent paid to landlord. It costs way more money to build those fancy utilities and design the space for community building, while not so many companies are willing to pay extra money on working space just for those features. 2. Many customers of WeWork are actually in the weakest position in case of an economic downturn, which is a big risk for WeWork.

* TransferWise
  * Great value proposition, change the traditional transfer pattern by transforming the oversea transfer to national transfer.
  * Launch provocative advertisements and different marketing campaigns.
  * Created other services like international debit card.

* Airbnb
  * Find the new customer segments, which is the vacation rental.
  * Airbnb is actually not the first company find this customer segment, but won the market by its innovations on value propositions: review system. The system makes everything transparent, which helps hosts and guests build their trust on each other.
  * Another value propositions include lower price (compare to hotels) and offer variety (different housing capacity and styles)

* Tesla
  * Excellent value propositions, including beautiful designs, long range battery, supercharger network, all of them are the top in industry.
  * The sales channel for Tesla is only their owned stores, no middle man, and usually open in shopping malls, which don't necessary make people directly buy it but increase their awareness.


## Intro to Business Model
* Customer Segments
  * B2B or B2C?
  * Mass market (Coca), niche market (Rolex) or multi-sided platform (Google)?
  * For a multi-sided platform (Twitch), the segments can be viewers, streamers and advertisers (or game companies)

* Value Propositions
  * Why people choose your product (and are willing to pay)? Do the analysis for each user segment.

* Channels (how to sell and deliver your product)
  * Sales: sales person or buying online?
  * Distribution: mail, self-pickup or deliver online?

* Customer Relationships (everything happens before and after the sale)
  * support desk, customer service group or community

* Revenue Streams (main source of revenue)
  * one-time, subscription, micropayments, licensing...

* Key Resources
  * physical (servers...), intellectual, human and financial
  * own or rent

* Key Activities (activities the company needs to do to provide its value propositions)
  * production, maintenance, marketing...

* Key Partners
  * suppliers, joint ventures, strategic alliances, coopetitions...

* Cost structure
  * fixed (rent, salaries...) & valuable (changes depending on the value)

## Designing Business Models
* Good companies can find the blue ocean by creating a new business pattern (tesla, spotify, uber, airbnb, netflix, ...) rather than just adding new features to products or reducing cost.

### Innovations on Value Propositions
* The typical ways to create value propositions include: performance (usually driven by science and technology research), sustainability (environmentally friendly), customization and product system (like home automation)
* Design is one of the most popular way to drive value proposition. Make product looks fancy (iphone, nest, dyson), make website looks better (use more images, put things on one page, make things bigger, no more bullet points) and make the mobile app better (simplified, visualized, emphasize the point at small screen)
* Think about the whole member journey (online research -> store visit -> purchase -> customer service -> membership), make a good design for each step of the journey.

### Customer Engagement
* How to acquire first-time customers?
  * Try for free, or allow refund (the refund rate is normally low)
  * Gamification (e.g. online courses), motivating people to keep using the product
  * Content marketing, publishing free useful content to attract customers' attention
  * Referral, let customers bring new customers

* How to keep and grow customers?
  * Community building, organize events to make customers active
  * Loyalty strategy, award system (collecting points for gifts)
  * Customer service, easy access customer service (e.g. apple genius bar)
  * Personalization, keep giving personalized recommendations to customers

* Customer segments
  * Find underserved customers, like the games for female, the construction toys for girls, and socializing bars for geeks/video game players.
  * Create whole new customer segment from scratch, airbnb, tesla and impossible food.

### Channels
  * The more urgent your demand is, the more expensive the channel offering that service can be. That's why people are willing to pay for the vending machine or Amazon prime.
  * AI is becoming a new sales channel, you can directly buy stuff from Amazon Alexa or Amazon dash button, the buying procedure is so simple and happens right after you have that demand.
