#### Difference of parametric and nonparametric statistics

#### Why do we use Nonparametric methods
We don't need to remember the formulas of those nonparametric statisical
testings becasuse most of them just work for a specific measurement and design.
What really matters are those ideas behind different nonparametric methods, they
help us jump out of the restrictions of classical distributions and think about
the data in different ways.

#### Some examples:

* Goodness of fit: Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test
* Rank statistic: Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
* Permutation test & Boostrap: http://www.mit.edu/~6.s085/notes/lecture5.pdf
